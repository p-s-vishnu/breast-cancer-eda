# Breast cancer analysis

Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in women, and the second main cause of cancer death in women, after lung cancer.

Advances in screening and treatment have improved survival rates dramatically since 1989. There are around [3.1 million](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/about/how-common-is-breast-cancer.html) breast [cancer](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/cancer-oncology/) survivors in the United States (U.S.). The chance of any woman dying from breast cancer is around 1 in 37, or 2.7 percent.

Analysis the datset can provide insights in identifying and mitigating the risks.
